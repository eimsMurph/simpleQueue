# simpleQueue
Simple FIFO queue in C using TDD

Plan: design a queue in C using TDD method, i.e. writing failing tests first, followed by implementations which make the test pass. Simple queue will need to have a data structure, initialise function, enqueue and dequeue functions as well as isFull and isEmpty helper functions.
